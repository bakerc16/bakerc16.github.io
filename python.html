                            so a lot of the work i've done is in python. So on my own time I tend to try different libraries within Pyhton to expand my knowledge. </div>

                        <div class="ferrari488__info"> A lot of applications today are being written in Python. Python is a simple language on the surface 
                            but as plenty of libraries that allows you to expand Pythons capabilities by a vast amount. It is also a very useful language for 
                            hackers to use to build their own tools, such as how I have built my own open port scanner. Python is also very fun to learn,
                            as it is very popular, there are plenty of tutorials out there to help beginners. It also uses simple syntax like "print()" to
                            have something printed to the console which makes it pretty fun.  </div>

                        <div class="ferrari488__info"> I kind of an interest in AI, and Python has plenty of libraries that will help with this.
                            So for the past few years, I have been researching these libraries to try and understand AI a bit better as they are going to be a
                            big part of the future. </div>

        <p class="blog__text">My name is Cole Baker. I am a second year Cyber Security student at NSCC. In fact, this is the first year NSCC
            has offered a Cyber Security class meaning that I will have the privalge of being one of the first students to complete this program. 
        </p>
        <p class="blog__text">Computers have always been an interest of mine, but when I started to learn programming a few years ago, I knew this was what I
            wanted to do for a future career. As the first step to improve my skills in the vast world of technology, I took co-op in high school
            so that I could have a chance to get some experience in the industry and improve my knowledge and skills at the same time. For my first
            of two co-ops, i decided to do engineering to get a feel for how the physical side of this technology worked. After completing a few months
            there, I decided that the physical side of this industry wasn't for me, which lead me to my second co-op choice. My second choice was
            really what camented the idea of Cyber Security for my future. I ended up at a local programming and web design firm, working on a few
            projects there to add apon what I already knew. This portfoilo would probably be the best example of what I learned there, it was the
            first time I had really done anything in the world of web development. I really enjoyed doing the work to create and design my own website,
            which really improve my knowledge on the subject. But it wasn't so much the programming the site that I was really interested in, once I
            finished building and designing the site, it was time to secure it which I was very intrested at the time. And because of the expereince I
            gained, it was what really made me want to contiune a career in Cyber Security. And that brings us to now, about to finish my first year at 
            NSCC and already have more experience and knowledge then I ever could have exepected.

        <h3 class="the__author">About The Portfolio</h3>
        <p class="author__text">Seeing as I am in the field of IT, it only seemed right that my portfoilo reflected that. So i decided to create
            my portfoilo from scratch, no website creater webistes, just pure HTML, CSS and a bit of javascript to try and highlight some of the 
            knowledge I already have.
